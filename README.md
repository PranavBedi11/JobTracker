## Testing the OAuth Client ID changes

2.  Open the extension's options page and confirm the "Google OAuth Client ID" field is gone.
3.  Open the extension's popup.
4.  If you had previously saved a custom ID, verify itâ€™s no longer used.
5.  Click the "Test connection" button on the options page and confirm that the OAuth flow still works as expected.
